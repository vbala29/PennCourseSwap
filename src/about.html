                <h2>Welcome to Penn Course Swap!</h2>
                <p style="padding-bottom: 3px">Penn Course Swap is a service that enables students to exchange courses with each other. We know it can be a hassle to get into all the courses you want.
                That's why we created Penn Course Swap -- a platform that connects you with students who have the course you want! Looking for people to swap classes with
                is currently both an inefficient and time consuming process. We offer an organized and easy-to-use platform that will help you find people to swap courses with
                and get the most out of your education.</p>
                <h3>How It Works</h3>
                <p style="padding-bottom: 3px">After you create an account, simply list the courses that you want and the courses that you are willing to drop.
                Whenever someone offers up a course you want in exchange for a course you don't want, we'll notify you!</p>

                <h3>Who We Are</h3>
                <p>As a team of close friends, we came to PennApps with two clear aims in mind: to improve as developers and to address a simple but important issue in the process of doing so. After some time and brainstorming, we settled on Penn Course Swap! Penn Course Swap was an idea born out of the collective struggle that we all share as Penn Students, as many of us have less than ideal course schedules with limited avenues to change them. Penn Course Review would provide us with opportunities to take on courses that we are truly interested in, by pairing us with other students who wish to do the same. Penn Course Swap is able to elevate levels of satisfaction for Penn students, and eliminate inefficiencies with the existing course selection process. We truly believe that this idea is able to make a difference with little to no trade off, and we are proud to present Penn Course Swap at PennApps this year. Cheers!</p>
