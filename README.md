# PennCourseSwap

PennApps '21 hackathon project by Vikram Bala. Languages and Frameworks used: Flask/Python, Flask-Mail, HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap, sqlite (with SQLAlchemy), Jinja2

How it works: After you create an account, simply list the courses that you want and the courses that you are willing to drop. Whenever someone offers up a course you want in exchange for a course you don't want, we'll notify you via email! The sooner you list your swaps, the higher you will be prioritized, so don't forget to sign up now.
